repository to create new types of neural network. 
For anyone who is reading this i am explaining my new idea about implementing neural network
in general neural network we implement F(W,x) = Wx + b then activation function for non linearity
i want to implement higher degree polynomial like F(V,W,x) = Vx<sup>2</sup> + Wx + b and F(U,V,W,x) = Ux<sup>3</sup> + Vx<sup>2</sup> + Wx + b which will give non linearity without activation function and to reduce computation time and use cpu for heavy task in small time that is possible only on gpu right now but in future it is possible with new types of neural networks
